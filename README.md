# Codsoft-task-3
This program simulates the basic functionality of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) using object-oriented programming in Java. It is structured around two main classes: one to represent a bank account and another to represent the ATM machine itself. The BankAccount class is responsible for managing the user's account balance and includes methods to perform three key operations: depositing money, withdrawing money, and checking the current balance. When a deposit is made, the system first validates whether the amount is positive before adding it to the existing balance. In the case of a withdrawal, the system checks whether the amount is both positive and not more than the current balance before deducting it. If these conditions are not met, appropriate error messages are shown—such as "invalid amount" or "insufficient balance." The ATM class serves as the interface that the user interacts with. It displays a menu with numbered options for checking balance, depositing funds, withdrawing money, and exiting the session. Based on the user’s input, the program uses a switch statement to call the appropriate method from the BankAccount class. Input validation is built in, so users receive feedback for invalid choices or failed transactions. A Scanner object is used to receive user input from the console, and a loop allows the user to perform multiple transactions until they choose to exit. The connection between the ATM and BankAccount classes ensures that all operations on the account balance are accurately performed and securely encapsulated within the bank account object. The program begins with an initial balance, and every operation affects that balance according to the user's actions. Throughout the session, the program provides clear messages that reflect the success or failure of each transaction, giving the user a realistic and interactive banking experience.
